We describe a modification of the existing technique where placement is assisted by guidance to the ischial spine by a finger introduced per anum.\n\n\nMETHOD\nCadaveric dissection was carried out to confirm the accuracy of this new approach. The surface marking of the ischial spine is marked. A stimulating needle electrode inserted through a skin incision at this point, is advanced towards the ischial spine using a finger introduced per anum as a guide. Once effective stimulation of the pudendal nerve is confirmed by observed and palpated contraction of the anal musculature, a permanent stimulating electrode is inserted and the position confirmed by radiological screening.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing cadaveric studies, the correct surface markings for needle placement were confirmed. This technique was then applied successfully for in vivo insertion of the needle electrode in 20 patients with bowel dysfunction, with only one lead displacement occurring over a mean follow-up period of 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFinger-guided assistance of PNS electrode insertion is simple and reproducible without requiring neurophysiological confirmation of nerve stimulation to ensure correct lead location.","pdfUrls":[],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0000c8f31b6058b1b42d9580c7afaa2e673a98c2","title":"A new minimally invasive technique for pudendal nerve stimulation.","venue":"Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland","year":2012}

The long terminal repeats (LTR) control HIV transcription and reflect the major differences of distinct viral subtypes. Three regions in the HIV-1 subtype B LTR are close matches to the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) consensus sequence. Here, we show heterogeneity in these putative STAT binding sites among HIV-1 LTR subtypes A through G. Transfection of constitutively activated STAT5 lead to transcriptional activation of HIV-1 expression in 293T cells transfected with a reporter assay driven by HIV-1 LTR subtype B. Constitutively activated STAT5 transactivated the LTR of various subtypes in U937 cells with different potency. These findings support and expand the potential relevance of STAT5 activation in HIV infection and may bear relevance for a differential regulation of latency and expression of different subtypes of HIV-1.","pdfUrls":["http://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVJ/TOVJ-1-26.pdf","https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVJ/TOVJ-1-26.pdf"],"s2Url":"http://semanticscholar.org/paper/0004750d9cfbedadef463fdd1071be1000ff21d3","title":"Heterogeneity of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription Binding Sites in the Long-Terminal Repeats of Distinct HIV-1 Subtypes","venue":"The open virology journal","year":2007}
